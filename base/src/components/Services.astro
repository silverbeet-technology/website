	Solutions we provide. Linux installation configuration hardening specialized
	server solution customized desktop solution Open source applications
	webservers nginx, apache, lighty, caddy * with free SSL certificats set to
	autorenew before experation (using Let's Encrypt) databases mysql, mariadb,
	postgres DNS servers Unbound Pihole, DNS Athe... (???) for adblocking chat
	servers everything from IRC to Matrix * rocketchat, mattermost uptime
	montitoring supporting internal and external systems, with a live page
	displaying at https://status.your_domain.com/ * setting up thresholds and
	notifications capacity planning who much do you need to do what you need to do
	* could this better served via a cloud solution versus a physical solution?
	NOTICE I list these solutions as 'recommended' since if people don't see the
	exact thing you're looking for, I would suggest they reach out and let me know
	what you're trying to accomplish. I suspect ideas from the above list would
	assist in archiving our goals. Failing that, we can work with what they have
	and I can make it work.

				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Running applications in containers like Docker provide flexibility to explore many types of software, and true infrastructure as code (IaC) where services can be saved and moved with minimal effort. Reproducability and scale are side effects.

				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Search engine optimization (SEO) is a big deal if you have a website and want to be found by Google and other search providers. There are some basic steps to take, and most web frameworks include a lot of bits already, but it's always good to review and update settings to be up to date.

				<p class="text-gray-600">
					A lot of what I do is discovery, figuring things out while building new systems and environments, and documenting what is done so it can be done correctly the next time is critical, which is why documentation is a part of every project.
