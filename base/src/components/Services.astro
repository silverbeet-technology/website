				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Security</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					I started my tech career researching security with the aim of setting
					up servers and services as securely as I could, but it's an ongoing
					process that is always changing. From doing basic pen-testing scans to
					configuring web servers and other network services to behave and
					protect; it's all part of the fun.

					Builds/Continous integration
				</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Builds with continuous integration is a DevOps development practice
					where developers regularly merge their code changes into a central
					repository. A pipeline is setup to provide the steps and access for a
					service like Jenkins, GitHub Actions or Azure CI/CD data pipelines
					provide this framework. A build, or artifact, is produced, which can
					then be reviewed.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Docker</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Running applications in containers like Docker provide flexibility to
					explore many types of software, and true infrastructure as code (IaC)
					where services can be saved and moved with minimal effort.
					Reproducability and scale are side effects.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">
					SSL Certificates
				</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Secure socket layer (SSL) certificates provide encryption, and thus
					security, but they also provide important information for verifying
					the owner of a website while encrypting web traffic with SSL/TLS.
					Buying SSL certificates used to be relatively expensive and require
					manual updating when they expire. New projects such as Let's Encrypt
					allow anyone to install free SSL certificates which are renewed
					automatically.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Windows</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600"></p>
				While most people thing running Windows, or systems that utilize proprietary
				software, makes using open source a foreign concept, that's not close to being
				true. In the early days I learned how to run the Apache webserver in Windows
				and an alternative to Microsoft's own IIS web service. Most build, and DevOps
				concepts can be applied to Windows to provide a more controlled, and secured,
				environment.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Ansible</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Ansible is a tool that defines a systems' configuration saved as a set
					of files that defines all aspects of its setup; from what applications
					are installed, to how the system is configured, etc. This idea of
					Infrastructure as Code (IaC) insures systems will always be in line
					with how it is configured within Ansible, which avoides errors
					introduced manually, and providing reproduce-able systems.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">SEO</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					Search engine optimization (SEO) is a big deal if you have a website
					and want to be found by Google and other search providers. There are
					some basic steps to take, and most web frameworks include a lot of
					bits already, but it's always good to review and update settings to be
					up to date.

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-2">Documentation</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					A lot of what I do is discovery, figuring things out while building
					new systems and environments, and documenting what is done so it can
					be done correctly the next time is critical, which is why
					documentation is a part of every project.

					But wait,there's more...
				</h3>
				<p class="text-gray-600">
					One size does not fit all, and I'm cognizant of the fact that there
					are virtually infinite ways to solve technical issues, which is why
					I'm able to take a projects requirements and break it down to steps we
					can take. Let me know what you're trying to accomplish, from there we
					will assist in archiving your goals.
