					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>
						Over 25 years ago I starting in tech support helping users run
						Windows desktops, setting up and maintaining printers, running
						network and phone cables, building and configuring servers of all
						types (Windows NT, Novell Netware, Sun Solaris, GNU/Linux), and I
						quickly felt discovered an affinity in helping make technology work
						for the users. Its this quality I've built on over the years, always
						providing solutions that others could use to make their lives
						better, or at least less frustrating in terms of using technology.
					</p>

					<h2>Open Source software and Linux</h2>
					<p>
						Once I discovered Open Source, and Linux in particular, around 1999
						changed the game for me, and set me on the path I still proudly
						explore. Having the ability to learn on my own, playing in not only
						various Linux varieties (distributions like Red Hat, Slackware,
						Gentoo, Debian, etc), but being able to run any Open Source software
						I wanted to try out and learned gave me the freedom to explore and
						learn.
					</p>

					<h2>Public speaking and published papers</h2>
					<p>
						While learning along with discovery is the fun part of IT (for me),
						sharing that later via online posts on blogs, or presented as a
						talk, or even a published paper, is an important final piece of the
						puzzle. As we 'stand on the shoulders of giants' (see more a few
						sections down), this allows us to continue that practice that allows
						others to learn from our ideas and approaches. I have all of my
						former talks, presentations, and published papers <a
							href="https://www.slideshare.net/phil.cryer?itemsPerPage=18"
							>online for review</a
						>. I've presented on IT security at information security (infosec)
						conferences like DEF CON, BSidesLV, Derbycon, and others. Earlier
						work focused on my day job, building systems that presented and
						preserved biodiversity data publicly, free for all to access and
						learn from. Papers about setting up systems at the architecture
						level detailed considerations to provide a secure and stable system
						to rely on.

					<h2>Goals</h2>
					<p>
						When starting Silverbeet Technology I had some goals in mind, the
						gist of those concepts are as follows.
					</p>
					<ul>
						<li>
							Make the most of technology for our clients by utilizing open
							source software, proven DevOps ideals and automated builds for
							reliability, security and reproducibility.
						</li>
						<li>
							In creating my own IT consultancy as an opinionated expert, I want
							to focus on 'right-sizing' client's software solutions, with a
							strong focus on Linux and Open Source software where applicable,
							but being amenable to work with customers' existing solutions.
						</li>
						<li>
							Every company needs software, but few know enough to make smart
							decisions; knowing when to buy versus when to build. Often
							building is just a matter of knowing about free, open source
							solutions that can provide all you need, for no, or little, cost.
							Trust me, I care about this stuff, and I'm not afraid to share my
							opinions on the topic.
						</li>
						<li>
							Provide Computer Systems Design and Related Services,
							Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, Computer related
							consulting services, Business services at non-commercial site,
							Middle-ware Configuration and Administration, Web Presence
							Services, Technical Support Services
						</li>
					</ul>

					<h2>Standing on the shoulders of giants</h2>
					<p>
						The beginning of free software, eventually referred to as open
						source, started as a concept that Eric S. Raymond detailed in his
						book, <a
							href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar"
							>The Cathedral and the Bazaar</a
						>, where traditional software development follows the cathedral
						model of source code (the building blocks of the software) is
						restricted to an exclusive group of software developers contrasts
						with the bazaar model, where the code is developed over the Internet
						in view of the public, and the source code is open and available for
						anyone to download, modify, build, and depending on the type of Open
						Source license, redistribute with those changes. It is noteworthy
						that Raymond credited Linus Torvalds, the leader of the Linux kernel
						project, as the inventor of this process.
					</p>
					<p>
						The ideas started by Raymond and Torvalds redefined how we use
						computers, in fact if you're reading this you're accessing files on
						a Linux server, which runs a Docker container with a Rust based
						static webserver for your browser to display the html. The fact that
						it's all open source, and all of the source code is freely available
						is a concept which used to be unheard of, but has now shown its
						worth as the way to develop software.
