# website

This is the code for the [Silverbeet Technology](https://silverbeet.tech/) website, built with [Astro](https://astro.build) and the [Astro Base](https://astro.build/themes/details/astro-base/) theme. Viva Open Source!

## icons

We use [tabler icons](https://tabler.io/icons), and you should too!

## eratta

Once I had the Astro project created, before I could built it I had to install another package:

```shell
npm install -D terser
```

### thanks
